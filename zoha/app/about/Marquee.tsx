        <h2>My name is Zoha Khan.</h2>I am a passionate individual who recently
        completed my commerce education. However, my heart has always been drawn
        towards technology. Therefore, I pursued a Web Development course after
        completing my education, where I gained in-depth knowledge of HTML, CSS,
        and Javascript. Throughout my journey, I have transformed my passion
        into action by working on various projects that showcase my technical
        skills. This journey has provided me with opportunities to explore new
        horizons and face new challenges. Currently, I am diligently studying
        TypeScript to further enhance my development capabilities. Additionally,
        I am exploring the realms of Web3, Metaverse and Artificial Intelligence
        to stay ahead in the ever-evolving field of technology. I do not claim
        to have learned everything, but I can confidently say that I am
        committed to learning new things every day and improving my skills. If
        you are seeking a dedicated team member who is not afraid to tackle new
        challenges, let's connect and embark on a journey towards a better
        future together.
